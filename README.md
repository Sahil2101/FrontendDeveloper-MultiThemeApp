## 📘 Description

This is a React-based application that allows users to switch between three distinct themes — Light, Dark, and Blue. Each theme modifies the entire layout, font styles, spacing, and color scheme of the UI. The selected theme is saved using `localStorage` so it persists across browser reloads.
